Metrics
=======

This program can automatically collect metrics for a given project.


Configuration
-------------
The file `config.edn` contains configurable things, including the SonarQube
project key. The token must be generated in SonarQube (My Account -> Security
-> Generate Token). The current token is my own for testing purposes, please
don't abuse.


Running
-------
`lein run`
